The [djbdns] collection of Domain Name System tools, translated automatically
from C to Rust using [Corrode].

## Status

tl;dr: not ready to use

The original C source code has been translated into Rust using [Corrode] and
removed from the tree.

The resulting Rust is as correct as Corrode's semantics, but uses the C FFI to
make calls to all functions internal to the project.

The next steps will be converting the existing code into proper Rust modules
and ensuring they compile. This will involve:

- Consolidating common functionality into the same Rust module
- Removing `#[no_mangle]` and `extern "C"` from function definitions
- Replacing C function pointers with `Fn`
- Removing redundant `modulenamespace_*` from the names of functions and
  leaning on the Rust module system instead
- Capitalizing the names of structs
- Replacing `extern` definitions for C standard library functionality with
  calls to the `libc` crate. Once complete, the code should be free of all
  `externs`

Any changes which rename or otherwise change APIs should be made across the
entire codebase at once, to ensure it (hopefully) continues to compile. This
will have to be done on a "best effort" basis until all of the code is
compiling.

Beyond these changes, which are hopefully all cosmetic, the goal is to leave
all existing function definitions, including function arguments and return
values, exactly as they are presently until all code is compiling with the
Rust compiler. This will ensure that any future changes at least compile!

After all code is compiling, the goal is to get the original djbdns test
suite running and confirm that the translated code actually works.
Ideally we can run that test suite (or equivalent one) as part of the
CI pipeline to prevent regressions.

Once all of that is done, the real fun can begin: replacing pointers with
references, `i32` return values with `Result`, deleting code that duplicates
Rust standard library functionality and using `std` alternatives to replace
it, and rewriting the unsafe translated code in safe Rust.

### Obtaining original C source code

This project contains only mechanical Rust translations of the original C
source code which may be hard to understand. If you are working on improving
the code, you may want to look at the original C sources to better understand
the intended behavior of the original code.

The easiest way to view the original C source code is by reverting the commit
which removed it from this repository:

```shell
$ git revert 0e95d96a7
```

Please use this only to view the original code. Do not open PRs with this
commit reverted.

You can also download the original sources from:
