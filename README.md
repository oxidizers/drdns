### Obtaining original C source code

This project contains only mechanical Rust translations of the original C
source code which may be hard to understand. If you are working on improving
the code, you may want to look at the original C sources to better understand
the intended behavior of the original code.

The easiest way to view the original C source code is by reverting the commit
which removed it from this repository:

```shell
$ git revert 4c1a7d0fd
```

Please use this only to view the original code. Do not open PRs with this
commit reverted.

You can also download the original sources from:
